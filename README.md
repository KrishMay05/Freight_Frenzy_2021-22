# Freight_Frenzy_2021-22
Code for FTC Freight Frenzy game, I worked on this code my junior year of high school. 
Recycled previous years' code while updating and modifying to account for changes made to the hardware of the robot. Eventually, we created a new robot so a lot of the code had to be modified.

Auton: Multiple different cases where the robot performs different tasks without human intervention 
MecanumControlV2: Allows for user control of all the motors and servos using custom classes which make motor movement intuitive and easy to control with a Logitech controller 
MecanumDrive: Maps all the drive motors to the correct ports on the control hub
MotorControl: Map all the extra attachment motors to the correct ports on the control hub
Servos: Maps all the servos to the correct ports on the control hub
